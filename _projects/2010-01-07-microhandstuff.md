## Description
Simple and tidy micro handcuff (Western style) stuff, very cheap, easy to source, prepare and wear.

## Materials

| Item         | Quantity |                                                   |
| --------         | ------   | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Hair clips   | 1   |                                 |
| Bobby pins      | 1       |                                                       |
| Nylon cord    | 1        |                                                         |



## Preparation
- With a pair of pliers, cut the bobby pin up to a length that is comfortable for you (about 25mm should do). Cut the flat 'arm' about 10mm shorter.  
    If you don't cut any of it, you will need to strip the rubber from the tip.  
    Bend the last 4mm of the longer arm away from the flat short arm, about 45 degrees.


- Snap the hair clip by bending the widest part at the point where it divides into multiple arms. You can then cut it to a length that is comfortable, optionally cut the pivot point out.

- Take out rough edges with a file or sanding paper. 

- Cut a small (less than 25mm) piece of cord, take the nylon strands out. Melt one end and quickly seal it closed with the pliers. Fuse the frayed threads in the other end but keep it open. 

Now the stuff can be put inside, it will be a tight fit (you can heat the middle a little and slightly press on it otherwise).

The 'pouch' can be put wherever you need and is easy to sew onto clothes. The smaller the tools are, the harder they will be to retrieve and use, especially with wet hands. Leaving the items with 'two arms' allows for the option to extend them at an angle and have a little more leverage when using them.
