## Description
Ultra low power ATtiny85-based 'glass PCB' style electronics sculpture, featuring a pair of position and strobe lights that activate automatically at night. An abstract representation of an aircraft, quite useless if you ask me.  
I need to get a power profiler to find the real power consumption but it's been running for weeks now on a 30mAh coin cell.

## Materials

| Item         | Quantity | Description                                                  |

| CR927 coin cell | 1 | 3V |
| 90ยบ pin headers | 6 | To make a dirty surface-mount battery holder |
| Epoxy | | Optional but desirable to secure everything in place |

## Schematics

## Preparation
- Program the ATtiny85, I used Arduino as ISP.

- Print the circuit guide, place it beneath the glass and replicate it over the glass with thin copper tape. If the adhesive side is non-conductive, solder the tape joints. Use flux and low temperature or you'll burn the tape.

- Use the schematic and footprint diagram as a guide to place and solder the components. Start with the pin headers (bend them inwards a little with pliers to give them enough tension to hold the coin cell) and work your way out to the edges.

## Program

This project uses the [TinySnore library][snore]. The program is uploaded using Arduino as ISP.

```cpp
#include <tinysnore.h>        // Low power library; not needed, but makes it simpler
 
const byte ledsPin = 1;       // Low If LED-resistor combination allows to stay well under the 20mA output limit
const byte beaconPin = 0;
const byte ldrpwrPin = 2;     // Pin to 'power up' the LDR only while we read the voltage
const byte ldrdataPin = 3;    // Voltage read 
 
void setup() {
  pinMode(ledsPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(ldrpwrPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(beaconPin, OUTPUT);
  pinMode (4, INPUT_PULLUP);  // Save some power, probably redundant
}
 
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(ldrpwrPin, HIGH);              // Power up the LDR
  delay(5);                                   // Stabilize
  int sensorValue = analogRead(ldrdataPin);   // Read LDR at voltage divider
  digitalWrite(ldrpwrPin, LOW);               // Power down LDR
  if (sensorValue <= 300) {                   // Modify value to make it more or less sensitive to light (0-1023)
    digitalWrite(beaconPin, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(ledsPin, HIGH);
    delay(15);                                // The beacon is flashing
    digitalWrite(beaconPin, LOW);
    snore(1000);                              // Go to sleep with the position lights ON; change value to
  }                                           // change flashing interval
  else {
    digitalWrite(ledsPin, LOW);
    snore(3000);                              // Go to sleep with the position lights OFF; increase
  }                                           // value to save power but it'll be less reactive
  delay(10);
}
