## Description
A simple tiny red light, made for quick and discreet usage. It lights up only while the button is pressed, measures about 15x10mm. The battery is replaceable.

Red is chosen because it doesn't spoil the natural night vision of our eyes, but if you're going to be working with red text/items you probably should use a different light colour.



## Materials

| --------         | ------   | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SMD tactile button   | 1   | SPST                               |
| SMD LED      | 1       | Red                                                      |

| CR927 battery       | 1        | 3V 30mAh                   coin cell                         |
| Shrink tube       | 1        |                                            |
| Hot glue       | 1        |                                            |


## Preparation
- Solder the components as shown in the schematic:

    ![ALT]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/p2_sch.png)

- If you twirl a bit of wire and put solder on it, you can make flat contact pads where the resistor and switch touch the battery.

- Put shrink tube around the button. Put the items in position with the battery and place hot glue around them, but don't cover the switch, nor the battery. Then wrap the thing in shrink tube, leaving the front clear, and heat it.
