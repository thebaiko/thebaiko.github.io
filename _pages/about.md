I publish a small percentage of the stuff I make and make a small percentage of the stuff I think about.
Which is the same as saying that I tend to come up with ideas but I'm not able to keep up with the amount of learning that they entail. But I'm working to catch up.

I'm interested in creativity, red teaming (the physical and social kinds), engineering and any combination of them.
